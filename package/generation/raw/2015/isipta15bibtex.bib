We propose a correction method for the merging of two separate assessments whose direct juxtaposition could be incoherent, and for the revision of beliefs where the core of the assessment must remain unchanged. A prototypical example on antidoping analysis guides the reader through this article to explain the various procedures.},

  ABSTRACT = {A statistical model can be constructed from a null probability measure by defining a set of statistics representing log-likelihood ratios of alternative measures to the null measure. Conversely, any model consisting of equivalent measures can be so expressed. A linear combination of statistics will also define a log-likelihood ratio if the normalizing constant is finite. In this way, any such model can be naturally extended to a convex subset of the linear span of these statistics. A finite dimensional subset defines an exponential family with the canonical parameters of a measure defined by coordinates relative to a set of basis functions.
Given a base measure on the parameter space, one can implement a similar structure with a set of parametric functions. The log-likelihood itself being a parametric function, the set of all possible log-likelihoods thus defines a space of measures conjugate to the statistical model. The conjugate space will have one more dimension spanned by the above-mentioned parameter-dependent normalizing constant.
If the base measure is considered a prior distribution, then the translation by the observed log-likelihood defines the posterior. An imprecise prior defined by a set of measures is in the same manner translated to a set of posterior measures. Upper and lower previsions can then be computed as extrema over this posterior set.},

  ABSTRACT = {In the paper we consider the generalization of the conjunctive rule in the theory of imprecise probabilities. Let us remind that the conjunction rule, produced on credal sets, gives their intersection and it is not defined if this intersection is empty. In the last case the sources of information are called contradictory. Meanwhile, in the Dempster-Shafer theory it is possible to use the conjunctive rule for contradictory sources of information having as a result a non-normalized belief function that can be greater than zero at empty set. In the paper we try to exploit this idea and introduce into consideration so called generalized credal sets allowing to model imprecision (non-specificity), conflict, and contradiction in information. Based on generalized credal sets the conjunctive rule is well defined for contradictory sources of information and it can be conceived as the generalization of the conjunctive rule for belief functions. We also show how generalized credal sets can be used for modeling information when the avoiding sure loss condition is not satisfied, and consider coherence conditions and natural extension based on generalized credal sets.},

Given a function g and a family X_λ of random variables, where the parameter λ ranges in an index set Λ, one may ask for the upper/lower probability that g(X_λ) belongs to some Borel set B. Two interpretations are investigated. In the first case, the upper probability is computed as the supremum of the probabilities that g(X_λ) lies in B. In the second case, one considers the random set generated by all g(X_λ), λ∈Λ, e.g. by transforming X_λ to standard normal as a common probability space, and computes the corresponding upper probability. The two results are different, in general. We analyze this situation and highlight the implications for Monte Carlo simulation. Attention is given to efficient simulation procedures and an engineering application is presented.},

  ABSTRACT = {This paper deals with the derivation of a probabilistic parametric model from interval or fuzzy data using the maximum likelihood principle. In contrast with classical techniques such as the EM algorithm, that define a precise likelihood function by averaging inside each imprecise observations, our approach presupposes that each imprecise observation underlies a precise one, and that the uncertainty that pervades its observation is epistemic, rather than representing noise. We define an interval-valued likelihood function and apply robust optimisation methods to find a safe plausible estimate of the statistical parameters. The resulting density has a standard deviation that is large enough to cover the imprecision of the observations, making a pessimistic assumption on dispersion. This approach is extended to fuzzy data by optimizing the average of lower likelihoods over a collection of data sets obtained from cuts of the fuzzy intervals, as a trade off between optimistic and pessimistic interpretations of fuzzy data. The principles of this method are compared with those of other existing approaches to handle incompleteness of observations, especially the EM technique.},

Some of the advantageous properties of these models are based on the fact that factorization and conditional independence coincide. It means that a decomposable multidimensional model can be assembled (composed) from its low-dimensional marginals with the help of an operator of composition, which introduces conditional independence relations among the variables.
The problem arises when we also want to apply these ideas in Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence, because two different operators of composition have been introduced in literature. The present paper serves as a survey of results on these two operators, recollects their common properties and differences, and tries to find a proper role for each of them.},

This paper also shows that such a failure occurs when we extend the framework of incomplete information games to allow for a representation of uncertainty using sets of probabilities and the use of Γ-maximin. Nevertheless, the key to this negative result is that a phenomenon called dilation of sets of probabilities obtains in this generalized setting.},

  ABSTRACT = {A Gaussian Process (GP) defines a distribution over functions and thus it is a natural prior distribution for learning real-valued functions from a set of noisy data. GPs offer a great modeling flexibility and have found widespread application in many regression problems. A GP is fully defined by a mean function that represents our prior belief about the shape of the regression function and a covariance function, relating the function values at different covariates. In the absence of prior information, one typically assumes a GP with zero mean function. Therefore, a priori, it is assumed that the regression function is constantly equal to zero. The aim of this paper is to model a situation of prior near-ignorance about the GP mean function. For this we consider the set of all GPs with fixed covariance function and constant mean function free to vary from −∞ to +∞. We apply the model with constant mean function to hypothesis testing; in particular we test the equality of two regression functions and show that the use of a prior near-ignorance model allows the test to automatically detect when a reliable decision cannot be made based on the available data. Finally, we propose a generalization of this model that allows considering other sets of prior mean functions.},

Such dynamics can be modelled by a non-stationary stochastic process, where crop transition probabilities are multinomial logistic functions of such external factors. We use a robust Bayesian approach to estimate the parameters of our model, and validate it by comparing the model response with a non-parametric estimate, as well as by cross validation. Finally, we use the resulting predictions to solve a hypothetical yet realistic policy problem.},

  ABSTRACT = {The paper deals with parameter estimation for categorical data under epistemic data imprecision, where for a part of the data only coarse(ned) versions of the true values are observable. For different observation models formalizing the information available on the coarsening process, we derive the (typically set-valued) maximum likelihood estimators of the underlying distributions. We discuss the homogeneous case of independent and identically distributed variables as well as logistic regression under a categorical covariate. We start with the imprecise point estimator under an observation model describing the coarsening process without any further assumptions. Then we determine several sensitivity parameters that allow the refinement of the estimators in the presence of auxiliary information.},

  ABSTRACT = {In surveys, and most notably in election polls, undecided participants frequently constitute subgroups of their own with specific individual characteristics. While traditional survey methods and corresponding statistical models are inherently damned to neglect this valuable information, an ontic random set view provides us with the full power of the whole statistical modelling framework. We elaborate this idea for a multinomial logistic regression model (which can be derived as a discrete choice model for voting behaviour) and an imprecise classification tree, and apply them as a prototypic illustration to the German Longitudinal Election Study 2013. Our results corroborate the importance of a sophisticated, random set-based modelling. Furthermore, by reinterpreting the undecided respondents' answers as disjunctive random sets, general forecasts based on interval-valued point estimators are calculated.},

We use the ingredients of Dempster-Shafer theory to characterize a necessity measure and the extreme points of its core in terms of the Moebius inverse, as well as an interpretation of the elements of the core as obtained through a transfer of probability mass from non-elementary events to singletons. With this understanding we derive an exact formula for the number of extreme points of the core of a necessity measure and obtain a constructive combinatorial insight into how the extreme points are obtained in terms of mass transfers. Our result sharpens the bounds for the number of extreme points given in [15] or [14, 13]. Furthermore, we determine the number of edges of the core of a necessity measure and additionally show how our results could be used to enumerate the extreme points of the core of arbitrary belief functions in a not too inefficient way.},

Specifically, we analyse the reliability of power networks under very weak statistical assumptions, explicitly accounting for non-stationary failure and repair rates and the limited accuracy by which common cause failure rates can be estimated. Bounds on typical quantities of interest are derived, namely the expected time spent in system failure state, as well as the expected number of transitions to that state. A worked numerical example demonstrates the theoretical techniques described. Interestingly, the number of iterations required for convergence is observed to be much lower than current theoretical bounds.},

L2 -norm and L∞-norm SVMs are used for constructing the algorithms. The main idea allowing us to represent the complex optimization problems as a set of simple linear or quadratic programming problems is to approximate the Gaussian kernel by the well-known triangular and Epanechnikov kernels. The minimax strategy is used to choose an optimal probability distribution from the set and to construct optimal separating functions.},

Once this is in place, we present an axiomatisation of indifference in terms of desirability. On this we build our characterisation of indifference in terms of choice functions.},

We prove that a perfect sequence of credal sets is a convex hull of perfect sequences of extreme points of these credal sets. Finally, we reveal the relationship among credal networks (in a general sense), perfect sequences of credal sets and separately specified credal networks.},

  KEYWORDS = {support vector regression, interval data, representer theorem},
  ABSTRACT = {In the recent years, generalizations of support vector methods for analyzing interval-valued data have been suggested in both the regression and classification contexts. Standard Support Vector methods for precise data formalize these statistical problems as optimization problems that can be based on various loss functions. In the case of Support Vector Regression (SVR), on which we focus here, the function that best describes the relationship between a response and some explanatory variables is derived as the solution of the minimization problem associated with the expectation of some function of the residual, which is called the risk functional. The key idea of SVR is that even when considering an infinite-dimensional space of arbitrary regression functions, given a finite-dimensional data set, the function minimizing the risk can be represented as the finite weighted sum of kernel functions. This allows to practically determine the SVR estimate by solving a much simpler optimization problem, even in the case of nonlinear regression. In case that only interval-valued observations of the variables of interest are available, it has been suggested to minimize the minimal or maximal risk values that are compatible with the imprecise data, yielding precise SVR estimates on the basis of interval data. In this paper, we show that also in the case of an interval-valued response the optimal function can be represented as the finite weighted sum of kernel functions. Thus, the minimin and minimax SVR estimates can be obtained by minimizing the corresponding simplified expressions of the empirical lower and upper risks, respectively.},
