  abstract = 	 {This paper considers the resolution of ambiguity according to the scientific ideal of direct observation when there is a practical necessity for social learning. An agent faces ambiguity when she directly observes low-quality data yielding set-identified signals. I suppose the agent's objective is to choose the single belief replicating what would occur with high-quality data yielding point-identified signals. I allow the agent to solve this missing data problem using signals observed through her network in combination with a model of social learning. In some cases the agent's belief formation reduces to DeGroot updating and beliefs in a network reach a consensus. In other cases the agent's updating can generate polarization and sustain clustered disagreement, even on a connected network where everyone observes the same data and processes that data with the same model.}

They make use of a "near-ignorance" model, that behaves a priori as a vacuous model for some basic inferences, but it provides non-vacuous posterior inferences. We perform empirical studies regarding the behavior of IDP-tests for the particular case of Wilcoxon rank sum test. We show that the upper and lower posterior probabilities can be expressed as tail probabilities based on the value of the $U$ statistic. We construct an imprecise frequentist-based test that reproduces the same decision rule as the the IDP test. It considers a neighbourhood around the $U$-statistic value. If all the values in the neighbourhood belong to the rejection zone (resp. to the acceptance region), the null hypothesis is rejected (resp. accepted). Otherwise, the judgement is suspended.}

In particular, we define a notion of computable randomness associated with interval, rather than precise, forecasting systems, and study its properties. The richer mathematical structure that thus arises lets us better understand and place existing results for the precise limit. When we focus on constant interval forecasts, we find that every infinite sequence of zeroes and ones has an associated filter of intervals with respect to which it is computably random. It may happen that none of these intervals is precise, which justifies the title of this paper. We illustrate this by showing that computable randomness associated with non-stationary precise forecasting systems can be captured by a stationary interval forecast, which must then be less precise: a gain in model simplicity is thus paid for by a loss in precision.}

Taking a rigorous imprecision perspective, microaggregated data are understood inducing a set $X$ of potentially true data. Based on this representation two conceptually different approaches deriving estimations from the ideal likelihood are discussed. The first one picks a single element of $X$, for instance by naively treating the microaggregated data as true ones or by introducing a maximax approach taking the elements of $X$ as nuisance parameters to be optimized. The second one seeks, in the spirit of Partial Identification, the set of all maximum likelihood estimators compatible with the elements of $X$, thus creating cautious estimators. As the simulation study corroborates, the obtained sets of estimators of the latter approach are still precise enough to be practically relevant.}

Our approach presupposes that each imprecise observation underlies a precise one, and that the uncertainty that pervades its observation is epistemic, rather than representing noise. As a consequence, the likelihood function of the ill-observed sample is set-valued. In this paper, we apply a robust optimization method to find a safe plausible estimate of the probabilities of elementary events on finite state spaces. More precisely we use a maximin criterion on the imprecise likelihood function. We show that there is a close connection between the robust maximum likelihood strategy and the maximization of entropy among empirical distributions compatible with the incomplete data. A mathematical model in terms of maximal flow on graphs, based on duality theory, is proposed. It results in a linear objective function and convex constraints. This result is somewhat surprizing since maximum entropy problems are known to be complex due to the maximization of a concave function on a convex set.}

Our first approach relies on criteria that construct complete rankings of the acts based on generalized expectation intervals. Subsequently, we introduce different concepts of global admissibility that construct partial orders by comparing all acts simultaneously. Finally, we define criteria induced by suitable binary relations on the set of acts and, therefore, can be understood as concepts of local admissibility. Whenever suitable, we provide linear programming based algorithms for checking optimality/admissibility of acts.}

The first one coincides with the pignistic transformation proposed in the Transferable Belief Model the second one is not efficient in general, leading us to propose a normalized version. We consider a number of particular cases of lower probabilities: minitive measures, coherent lower probabilities, as well as the lower probabilities induced by comparative or distorsion models. For them, we provide some alternative expressions of the transformations and study when they belong to the core of the lower probability.}

Here we study the effectiveness of linear programming algorithms for determining whether or not a given set of desirable gambles avoids sure loss (i.e. is consistent). We also suggest improvements to these algorithms specifically for checking avoiding sure loss. By exploiting the structure of the problem, (i) we slightly reduce its dimension, (ii) we propose an extra stopping criterion based on its degenerate structure, and (iii) we show that one can directly calculate feasible starting points in various cases, therefore reducing the effort required in the presolve phase of some of these algorithms. To assess our results, we compare the impact of these improvements on the simplex method and two interior point methods (affine scaling and primal-dual) on randomly generated sets of desirable gambles that either avoid or do not avoid sure loss. We find that the simplex method is outperformed by the primal-dual and affine scaling methods, except for very small problems. We also find that using our starting feasible point and extra stopping criterion considerably improves the performance of the primal-dual and affine scaling methods.}

  abstract = 	 {In official statistics, the problem of sampling error is rushed to extremes when not only results on sub-population level are required, which is the focus of Small Area Estimation (SAE), but also missing data arise. When the nonresponse is wrongly assumed to occur at random, the situation becomes even more dramatic, since this potentially leads to a substantial bias. Even though there are some treatments jointly considering both problems, they are all reliant upon the guarantee of strong assumptions on the missingness. For that reason, we aim at developing cautious versions of well known estimators from SAE by exploiting the results from a recently suggested likelihood approach, capable of including tenable partial knowledge about the nonresponse behaviour in an adequate way. We generalize the synthetic estimator and propose a cautious version of the so-called LGREG-synthetic estimator in the context of design-based estimators. Then, we elaborate why the approach above does not directly extend to model-based estimators and proceed with some first studies investigating different missingness scenarios. All results are illustrated through the German General Social Survey 2014, also including area-specific auxiliary information from the German Federal Statistical Office's data report.}

  abstract = 	 {Dempster-Shafer (DS) belief theory is a powerful general framework for dealing with a wider variety of uncertainties in data. As in Bayesian probability theory, the conditional operation plays a critical role in DS theoretic strategies for evidence updating and fusion. A major limitation associated with the application of DS theoretic techniques for reasoning under uncertainty is the absence of a feasible computational framework to overcome the prohibitive computational burden this conditional operation entails. This paper addresses this critical challenge via a novel generalized conditional computational model — DS-Conditional-One — which allows the conditional to be computed in significantly less computational and space complexity. This computational model also provides valuable insight into the DS theoretic conditional itself and can be utilized as a tool for visualizing the conditional computation. We provide a thorough analysis and experimental validation of the utility, efficiency, and implementation of the proposed data structures and algorithms for carrying out both the Dempster's conditional and Fagin-Halpern conditional, the two most widely utilized DS theoretic conditional strategies.}

The experiment consisted of a betting competition for the 2014 FIFA World Cup: For each match bets were assigned based on the sets of acceptable gambles elicited from the participants. A new algorithm was designed for generating fair bets for assignment. Participant feedback indicated that improving the usability and transparency of the interface would ease the elicitation procedure.

  abstract = 	 {Coherent lower previsions are general probabilistic models allowing incompletely specified probability distributions. However, for complete description of a coherent lower prevision – even on finite underlying sample spaces – an infinite number of assessments is needed in general. Therefore, they are often only described approximately by some less general models, such as coherent lower probabilities or in terms of some other finite set of constraints. The magnitude of error induced by the approximations has often been neglected in the literature, despite the fact that it can be significant with substantial impact on consequent decisions. An apparent reason is that no widely used general method for estimating the error seems to be available at the moment. The goal of this paper is to provide such a method. The proposed method allows calculating an upper bound for the error of a finite approximation of coherent lower prevision on a finite underlying sample space. An estimate of the maximal error is especially useful in the cases where calculating assessments is computationally demanding. Our method is based on convex analysis applied to credal sets, which in the case of finite sample spaces correspond to convex polyhedra.}

A relatively unexplored approach is introduced, based on the fact that every cumulative distribution function (CDF) with support (0,1) has a "dual" CDF that obeys the conjugacy relation between coherent lower and upper probabilities. A new 2-parameter family of "CDF-Quantile" distributions with support (0,1) is extended via a third parameter for the purpose of modeling lower-upper probabilities. The extension exploits certain properties of the CDF-Quantile family, and the fact that continuous CDFs on (0,1) random variables form an algebraic group that is closed under composition. This extension also yields models for testing specific models of lower-upper probability assignments. Finally, the new models are applied to a real data-set, and compared with the alternative approaches for their relative advantages and drawbacks.}

The collection of (standardized) exact games forms a pointed polyhedral cone and the paper is devoted to the extreme rays of that cone, known as extreme exact games. A criterion is introduced for testing whether an exact game is extreme. The criterion leads to solving simple linear equation systems determined by (the vertices of) the core polytope (of the game), which concept corresponds to the notion of an induced credal set in the context of imprecise probabilities. The criterion extends and modifies a former necessary and sufficient condition for the extremity of a supermodular game, which concept corresponds to the notion of a 2-monotone lower probability. The linear condition we give in this paper is shown to be necessary for an exact game to be extreme. We also know that the condition is sufficient for the extremity of an exact game in an important special case. The criterion has been implemented on a computer and we have made a few observations on basis of our computational experiments.}

The main purpose is to reveal a connection between the possibility of agreeing to disagree and the interesting and anomalous phenomenon known as dilation. We show that for two agents who share the same set of priors and update by conditioning on every prior, it is impossible to agree to disagree on the lower or upper probability of a hypothesis unless a certain dilation occurs. With some common topological assumptions, the result entails that it is impossible to agree not to have the same set of posterior probabilities unless dilation is present. This result may be used to generate sufficient conditions for guaranteed full agreement in the generalized Aumman-setting for some important models of imprecise priors, and we illustrate the potential with an agreement result involving the density ratio classes. We also provide a formulation of our results in terms of "dilation-averse" agents who ignore information about the value of a dilating partition but otherwise update by full Bayesian conditioning.}
